This folder holds any third-party JavaScript code libraries you choose to download and host. These will eventually include Leaflet.js, D3.js, and potentially others. Some code libraries come with their own CSS stylesheets and images; leave these within the library's directory and place the entire directory within the lib folder to avoid confusion.
